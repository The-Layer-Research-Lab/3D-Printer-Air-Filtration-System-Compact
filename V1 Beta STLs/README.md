Here are the STL files for the Air Filtration System, but please do note that it is currently in BETA as I still have something to verify.

Recommended Print settings:<br />
Material: Preferably ABS*, PETG works too<br />
Infil: 40%<br />
Extrusion width: 0.4mm<br />
Wall line count: 4<br />
Solid top/bottom layer:4/5<br />
Support: on<br />
Above are the main things that need to be changed, other settings are dependent on the printer model and personal preferences.

*It is recommended to print the parts in ABS, PETG (or even PLA) will work but ABS is recommended for enclosed printers or high-heat environments.
Scaling the parts up by 1-5% can help to compensate for shrinkage when printing with ABS. (102% is what I am using) [Except for spacers as their size are already perfect, scaling will only be required if it doesn't fit. ] There is a setting in slicers that compensate the material shrink.

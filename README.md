# Air-Filtration-System-for-3D-Printer-and-Soldering

This project is still in progress!

The Air Filtration System was originally designed for use in 3D printers.
It is designed for recirculation filtration either in a printer with built-in enclosure or external enclosure.
The Air Filtration system can however be mounted and repurpoused to extract solder fumes and remove harmful substances from the surrounding to keep the user safe.

- Featuring HEPA filter and Activated Carbon the filter is able to remove VOC and particular matters(pm 2.5 & pm 10).
- The filter catridge can easily be taken out and easily be replaced.
- Because of the small form factor, it can be mounted on a wide range of machines. 

We will be working with resellers to provide build kits. So stay tuned!

# 3D Printer Air Filtration System-Compact

⚠️This project is still in progress!

The Air Filtration System was originally designed for use in 3D printers.
It is designed for recirculation filtration either in a printer with a built-in enclosure or an external enclosure.

- Featuring a HEPA filter and Activated Carbon the filter is able to remove VOC and particular matters(pm 2.5 & pm 10).
- It can be converted to a HEPA-only or Activated Carbon-only filter for specific use cases.
- The filter cartridge can easily be taken out and replaced.
- Because of the small form factor, it can be mounted on a wide range of machines. 

I've tried to make the form factor of the filter as small and as compact as possible. It can be printed on small printers like a Voron 0 (120x120). 

As mentioned, the main intention of this filter is to filter out harmful particles and compounds during 3D Printing, there have been many investigations showing that. I will link them below if you are interested!<br />

Recommended Print settings:<br />
Material: Preferably ABS*, PETG works too<br />
Infil: 40%<br />
Extrusion width: 0.4mm<br />
Wall line count: 4<br />
Solid top/bottom layer:4/5<br />
Support: on<br />
Above are the main things that need to be changed, other settings are dependent on the printer model and personal preferences. 

*It is recommended to print the parts in ABS, PETG (or even PLA) will work but ABS is recommended for enclosed printers or high-heat environments. <br />
Scaling the parts up by 1-5% can help to compensate for shrinkage when printing with ABS. (102% is what I am using) 
[Except for spacers as their size are already perfect, scaling will only be required if it doesn't fit. ]

Printed parts:<br />
1x Base mount<br />
1x Base cover<br />
1x Filter Mount or Filter Mount Max<br />
1x Filter Cover or Filter Cover Max<br />
1x Separator<br />
4x Spacers<br />
(Optional) 1x Air Duct<br />

Hardware list available in build guide.

V1 Beta is done and testing will be conducted.

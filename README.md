# Air-Filtration-System-for-3D-Printing-and-Soldering

This project is still in progress!

The Air Filtration System was originally designed for use in 3D printers.
It is designed for recirculation filtration either in a printer with built-in enclosure or external enclosure.
The Air Filtration system can however be mounted and repurpoused to extract solder fumes and remove harmful substances from the surrounding to keep the user safe.

- Featuring HEPA filter and Activated Carbon the filter is able to remove VOC and particular matters(pm 2.5 & pm 10).
- It can be converted to a HEPA only or Activated Carbon only filter for specific use case. 
- The filter catridge can easily be taken out and easily be replaced.
- Because of the small form factor, it can be mounted on a wide range of machines. 

First version is done and testing will be conducted. 

It is reccomended to print the parts in ABS, PETG will work but ABS is reccomended for enclosed printer or high heat environment. 

We will be working with resellers to provide build kits. So stay tuned!

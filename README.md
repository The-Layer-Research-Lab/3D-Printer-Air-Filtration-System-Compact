# Air-Filtration-System-for-3D-Printing-and-Soldering

⚠️This project is still in progress!

The Air Filtration System was originally designed for use in 3D printers.
It is designed for recirculation filtration either in a printer with built-in enclosure or external enclosure.
The Air Filtration system can however be mounted and repurpoused to extract solder fumes and remove harmful substances from the surrounding to keep the user safe. 

- Featuring HEPA filter and Activated Carbon the filter is able to remove VOC and particular matters(pm 2.5 & pm 10).
- It can be converted to a HEPA only or Activated Carbon only filter for specific use cases.
- The filter catridge can easily be taken out and be replaced.
- Because of the small form factor, it can be mounted on a wide range of machines. 

As mentioned, the original purpouse and main intention of this filter is to filter out harmful particles and compounds during 3D Printing, there have been many investigations showing that. I will link them below if you are interested!<br />

V1 Beta is done and testing will be conducted.

It is reccomended to print the parts in ABS, PETG will work but ABS is reccomended for enclosed printer or high heat environment. <br />
Scaling the part up by 1-5% can help to compensate shrinkage when printing with ABS. (2% is what I am using)

We will be working with resellers to provide build kits so stay tuned!

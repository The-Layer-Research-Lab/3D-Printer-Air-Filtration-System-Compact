# 3D-Printer-Air-Filtration-System

This project is still in progress!

The Air Filtration System was originally designed for use in 3D printers.
It is designed for recirculation filtration either in a printer with built-in enclosure or external enclosure.
The Air Filtration system can however be mounted and repurpoused to extract solder fumes and remove harmful substances from the surrounding to keep the user safe.

Featuring HEPA filter and Activated Carbon the filter is able to remove VOC and particular matters(pm 2.5 & pm 10).
